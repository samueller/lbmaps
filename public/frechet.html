                    This entry provides a visualization of Fréchet inequalities<cite id="cite-ref-1"><sup><a href="#ref-1">1</a></sup></cite>, also known as Boole-Fréchet inequalities. The reason for revisiting these inequalities 84 years after their first publication is two-fold:
                    <div class="content">
                        <ul>
                            <li>They play a major role in counterfactual reasoning<cite id="cite-ref-2"><sup><a href="#ref-2">2</a></sup></cite></li>
                            <li>We hadn't seen them visualized before using modern dynamic visualization techniques</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                    Hopefully, this is of help to people studying and using probability bounds. These bounds have wide application, including logic<cite id="cite-ref-3"><sup><a href="#ref-3">3</a></sup></cite>, artificial intelligence<cite id="cite-ref-4"><sup><a href="#ref-4">4</a></sup></cite>, statistics<cite id="cite-ref-5"><sup><a href="#ref-5">5</a></sup></cite>, quantum mechanics<cite id="cite-ref-6"><sup><a href="#ref-6">6</a></sup></cite>, and reliability theory<cite id="cite-ref-7"><sup><a href="#ref-7">7</a></sup></cite>. In counterfactual analysis, they come into focus when we have experimental results with behavior under treatment (X = x) as well as denial of treatment (X = x'). Our interests lie in finding individuals who are responsive to treatment, namely those who will respond if exposed to treatment and will not respond under denial of treatment. Those individuals have different names in different applications. They are called compliers, respondents, gullibles, influenceable, persuadable, malleable, pliable, impressionable, susceptive, overtrusting, or dupable. And as the reader can figure out, the applications in marketing, sales, recruiting, product development, politics, etc is enormous. Of course, much narrower bounds are obtained when we have both observational and experimental data<cite id="cite-ref-2"><sup><a href="#ref-2">2</a></sup></cite>.

                    The plots display lower bounds, upper bounds, range, and exact values of P(A, B) (conjunction) or P(A ∨ B) (disjunction) on the unit square with axes P(A) and P(B). The following inequalities are used:
                    <table class="table is-striped is-narrow is-hoverable">
                        <thead>
                            <tr><th>Truth Function</th><th>Inequality</th></tr>
                        </thead>
                        <tbody>
                            <tr><td>Conjunction</td><td><code>max{0, P(A) + P(B) − 1} ≤ P(A, B) ≤ min{P(A), P(B)}</code></td></tr>
                            <tr><td>Disjunction</td><td><code>max{P(A), P(B)} ≤ P(A ∨ B) ≤ min{1, P(A) + P(B)}</code></td></tr>
                        </tbody>
                    </table>
                </p>
                <p>
                    These are special cases (n = 2) of Fréchet inequalities:
                    <pre>max{0, P(A<sub>1</sub>) + P(A<sub>2</sub>) + … + P(A<sub>n</sub>) − (n − 1)} ≤ P(A<sub>1</sub>, A<sub>2</sub>, …, A<sub>n</sub>) ≤ min{P(A<sub>1</sub>), P(A<sub>2</sub>), …, P(A<sub>n</sub>)}
max{P(A<sub>1</sub>), P(A<sub>2</sub>), …, P(A<sub>n</sub>)} ≤ P(A<sub>1</sub> ∨ A<sub>2</sub> ∨ … ∨ A<sub>n</sub>) ≤ min{1, P(A<sub>1</sub>) + P(A<sub>2</sub>) + … + P(A<sub>n</sub>)}</pre>
                </p>
                <p>
                    If A and B are <em>independent</em>, then we can plot exact values for P(A, B) or P(A ∨ B):
                    <table class="table is-striped is-narrow is-hoverable">
                        <thead>

                        <tbody>
                            <tr><td>Conjunction</td><td><code>P(A)·P(B)</code></td></tr>
                            <tr><td>Disjunction</td><td><code>P(A) + P(B) - P(A)·P(B)</code></td></tr>

                <p>The gap between upper bounds and lower bounds gets vanishingly narrow near the edges of the unit square, which means that we can accurately determine the probability of the intersection given the probability of the marginal probabilities. The range plots make this very clear and they are the exact same plots for both P(A, B) and P(A ∨ B). Notice that the center holds the widest gaps. Every plot is symmetric around the P(B) = P(A) diagonal, this should be expected as P(A) and P(B) play interchangeable rolls in Fréchet inequalities.</p>
                <h3 class="title is-5">Example</h3>
                <p>Suppose we are conducting a marketing experiment and find 20% of customers will buy if shown advertisement 1, while 45% will buy if shown advertisement 2. We want to know how many customers are swayed by advertisement 2 and <em>not</em> advertisement 1. To see this in the plot above, let's make A = customer <em>doesn't buy</em> when shown advertisement 1 and B = customer <em>buys</em> when shown advertisement 2: <strong>P(A)</strong> = 100% - 20% = 80% = <strong>0.8</strong> and <strong>P(B)</strong> = 45% = <strong>0.45</strong>. We want to find P(A, B). This is <strong>conjunction</strong>, so let's click on <em>Lower bounds</em> next to conjunction. By tracing P(A) = 0.8 and P(B) = 0.45, you'll land in the middle of the blue strip corresponding to 0.2 to 0.3. This is the lower bounds, so P(A, B) ≥ 0.25. Now click on <em>Upper bounds</em> and trace again. You'll find P(A, B) ≤ 0.45. The <em>Combined</em> plot allows you to visualize both bounds at the same time.</p>
                <p>We might think that exactly 45% - 20% = 25% of customers were swayed by advertisement 2, but the plot shows us a range between 25% and 45%. How can this be? What if advertisement 2 convinces a <em>different segment of customers</em> to buy than advertisement 1 does? None of the 20% of customers who will buy after seeing advertisement 1 would buy if they had seen advertisement 2 instead. In this case, all 45% of the customers who will buy after seeing advertisement 2 are swayed by the advertisement.</p>
                <h2 class="title is-3">Maurice Fréchet</h2>
                <p>Maurice Fréchet was a significant French mathematician with contributions to <em>topology of point sets</em>, <em>metric spaces</em>, <em>statistics and probability</em>, and <em>calculus</em><cite id="cite-ref-8"><sup><a href="#ref-8">8</a></sup></cite>. Fréchet published his proof for the above inequalities in the French journal <a href="https://www.impan.pl/en/publishing-house/journals-and-series/fundamenta-mathematicae">Fundamenta Mathaticae</a> in 1935<cite id="cite-ref-9"><sup><a href="#ref-9">9</a></sup></cite>. During that time, he was Professor and Chair of Differential and Integral Calculus at <a href="https://www.sorbonne-universite.fr">the Sorbonne</a><cite id="cite-ref-10"><sup><a href="#ref-10">10</a></sup></cite>.</p>
                <p>Jacques Fréchet, Maurice's father, was head of a school in Paris<cite id="cite-ref-11"><sup><a href="#ref-11">11</a></sup></cite> while Maurice was young. Maurice then went to secondary school where he was taught math by the legendary French mathematician <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacques_Hadamard">Jacques Hadamard</a>. Hadamard would soon after become a professor at the University of Bordeaux. Eventually, Hadamard would become Fréchet's advisor for his doctorate. An educator like his father, Maurice was a schoolteacher in 1907, a lecturer in 1908, and then a professor in 1910<cite id="cite-ref-12"><sup><a href="#ref-12">12</a></sup></cite>. Probability research came later in his life. Unfortunately, his work wasn't always appreciated as the renowned Swedish mathematician <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harald_Cram%C3%A9r">Harald Cramér</a> wrote<cite id="cite-ref-13"><sup><a href="#ref-13">13</a></sup></cite>:
                <blockquote><p>In early years Fréchet had been an outstanding mathematician, doing pathbreaking work in functional analysis. He had taken up probabilistic work at a fairly advanced age, and I am bound to say that his work in this field did not seem very impressive to me.</p></blockquote>
                Nevertheless, Fréchet would go on to become very influential in probability and statistics. As a great response to Cramér's former criticism, an important bound is named after both Fréchet and Cramér, the <em>Fréchet–Darmois–Cramér–Rao inequality</em> (though more commonly known as <em><a href="http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Cram%C3%A9r-Rao_bound">Cramér–Rao bound</a></em>)!</p>
                <h2 class="title is-3">History</h2>
                <p>The reason Fréchet inequalities are also known as Boole-Fréchet inequalities is that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Boole">George Boole</a> published a proof of the conjunction version of the inequalities in his 1854 book <em>An Investigation of the Laws of Thought</em><cite id="cite-ref-14"><sup><a href="#ref-14">14</a></sup></cite>. In chapter 19, Boole first showed the following:
                <pre class="excerpt">Major limit of n(xy) = least of values n(x) and n(y)
Minor limit of n(xy) = n(x) + n(y) − n(1).</pre>
                n(<em>a</em>) means the number of occurrences of <em>a</em> and n(1) means the total number of occurrences. You can see that dividing all <em>n</em>-terms by n(1) yields the n = 2 Fréchet inequalities for P(x, y). Boole then arrives at two general conclusions:
<pre class="excerpt">    1st. The major numerical limit of the class represented by any constituent will be found by prefixing n separately to each factor of the constituent, and taking the least of the resulting values.
    2nd. The minor limit will be found by adding all the values above mentioned together, and subtracting from the result as many, less one, times the value of n(1).</pre>
                </p>
                <p>Boole's conjunction inequalities preceded Fréchet's by 81 years, so why aren't these known as Boole inequalities? One reason is Fréchet showed, for both conjunction and disjunction, that they are the narrowest possible bounds when only the marginal probabilities are known<cite id="cite-ref-15"><sup><a href="#ref-15">15</a></sup></cite>.</p>
                <p>Boole wrote a footnote in chapter 19 of his book that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augustus_De_Morgan">Augustus De Morgan</a>, who was a collaborator of Boole's, first came up with the minor limit (lower bound) of the conjunction of two variables:
<pre class="excerpt">the minor limit of nxy is applied by Professor De Morgan, by whom it appears to have been first given, to the syllogistic form:
        Most men in a certain company have coats.
        Most men in the same company have waistcoats.
        Therefore some in the company have coats and waistcoats.</pre>
                De Morgan wrote about this syllogism in his 1859 paper <em>On the Syllogism, and On the Logic of Relations</em><cite id="cite-ref-16"><sup><a href="#ref-16">16</a></sup></cite>.
                </p>
                <p>Predating Fréchet, Boole, and De Morgan is Charles Stanhope's <em>Demonstrator logic machine</em>, an actual physical device, that calculates Fréchet inequalities for conjunction with two events (n = 2). Robert Harley wrote an article in 1879 in <em>Mind: A Quarterly Review of Psychology and Philosophy</em><cite id="cite-ref-17"><sup><a href="#ref-17">17</a></sup></cite> that described Stanhope's instrument. In addition to several of these machines having been created, Stanhope had an unfinished manuscript of logic he wrote between 1800 and 1815 describing rules and construction of the machine for "discovering consequences in logic." In Stanhope's manuscript, he describes calculating the lower bound of conjunction with α, β, and μ, where α and β represent <em>all</em>, <em>some</em>, <em>most</em>, <em>fewest</em>, <em>a number</em>, or <em>a definite ratio of part to whole</em> (but not none), and μ is unity: "α + β - μ measures the extent of the consequence between A and B." This gives the "minor limit." Some examples are given by Harley. One of them is that <em>some</em> of 5 pictures hanging on the north side and <em>some</em> of 5 pictures are portraits tells us nothing about how many pictures are portraits hanging in the north. But if 3/5 are hanging in the north and 4/5 are portraits, then at least 3/5 + 4/5 - 1 = 2/5 are portraits on the north side. Similarly, with De Morgan's coats syllogism, "(most + most - all) men = some men" have both coats and waistcoats.</p>
                <p>The Demonstrator logic machine works by sliding red transparent glass from the right over a separate gray wooden slide from the left. The overlapping portion will look dark red. The slides represent probabilities, P(A) and P(B), where sliding the entire distance of the middle square represents a probability of 1. The reader can verify that the dark red (overlap) is equivalent to the lower bound, P(A) + P(B) - 1. To find the "major limit," or upper bound, simply slide the red transparent glass from the left on top of the gray slide. Dark red will appear as the length of the shorter of the two slides, min{P(A), P(B)}!</p>
